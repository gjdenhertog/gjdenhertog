# Style

I constantly learn and therefore gain new insights. I have a specific coding style which is adapted constantly with every new insight that I gain. This document captures the current rules I consider to be my style.
A lot of this is also inspired by books, blog posts and podcasts I consume. The biggest influence on my current status stems from the [Tiger Style](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/blob/main/docs/TIGER_STYLE.md).
